Preheat oven to 350°.
Sprinkle ½ teaspoon of Kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon of pepper, garlic powder, rosemary and thyme on all sides of the turkey tenderloins.
Heat an oven-safe, non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, add olive oil and swirl to lightly cover the bottom of the pan.
Place turkey tenderloins into hot pan and sear about 4-5 minutes until browned. Turn and sear the second side for an additional 4-5 minutes. Once seared, remove tenderloins from the pan and place in a container. Set aside.
Add onions to the same hot pan and sauté for 4-5 minutes or until soft and they begin to brown. Add remaining salt and pepper and stir.
Add chicken broth, vinegar and apples to the pan.  Stir and continue to sweat the onion-apple compote for about 3-5 minutes on medium heat until the liquid begins to reduce and apple begins to soften.
Add grape juice to the onion-apple compote.  Allow to come to a boil and remove from heat. Place reserved turkey tenderloins on the top of the compote.  Place pan in the oven and continue to roast tenderloin uncovered for about 25-30 minutes until the turkey is no longer pink in the middle and reaches an internal temperature of 160°.  The onion-apple compote will be soft and the liquid reduced by at least half.
Remove from the oven.  Place the tenderloins on a cutting board and allow meat to rest for about 5 minutes before slicing.  Slice tenderloin diagonally and serve with onion-apple compote.",NA,Entree,6,220
